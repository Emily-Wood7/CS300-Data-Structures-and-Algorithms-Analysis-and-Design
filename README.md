# DSA-Analysis-and-Design
**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
I was working with a fictional school ABC University.  They were looking for software that will help their computer science advisors access course information for students.  I designed code that read the course data file, created a menu that prompts a user for menu options, developed code to load data from the file into a data structure, sorted and printed out all the available courses, and used user prompt to search for a course and print out its number, name, and prerequisites if they exist.

**How did you approach the problem?  Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
I started by creating the easy portions: the menu, the opening of the file, the output, etc.  I then created the methods and filled them in. I used the pseudocode I created in previous weeks to implement a lot of the methods.  From GeeksforGeeks, “Data structure and algorithms help in understanding the nature of the problem at a deeper level and thereby a better understanding of the world.”

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
I struggled a bit with splitting a string, since C++ doesn’t have a function for it.  Thank you to Google for offering a solution.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
I worked more in the planning process through designing and creating pseudocode and approaching coding on paper prior to getting into the IDE.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I was able to get a better grasp of object-oriented programming in this class and using methods for more things so it is easier to fix.
